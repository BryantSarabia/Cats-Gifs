# Cats Facts & Gifs :)

Given these 2 APIs:

- https://catfact.ninja/fact - **Cat Random Facts**
- https://developers.giphy.com/docs - **Giphy API**

Select one random cat fact and look for a matching gif by using	
the first 3 words of the fact.<br>
The result should be displayed with the image on the left side and the text on the right side of the screen, both elements positioned in the middle.

Here you can find a valid GIPHY API KEY: **jBYWrr3HG4GWiJfV0SidZeOnfWDU0kk8**

> **Note**  
> API Key rate is limited to 42 searchs per hour and 1000 searches/API calls per day.
> I suggest to mock the response from GIPHY API while developing in order to avoid reaching the API limit
> or you can request your own API Key for free [Here](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide).
